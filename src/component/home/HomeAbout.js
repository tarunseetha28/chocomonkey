It is the most interesting and most important use case for non-fungible token mechanics, NFTs have provided a significant opportunity for the Arts thanks to the ownership opportunities they introduce. However, in this paper, we are going to focus on getting the real valuable reward of money from Chocolate Monkey NFTs<br /><br />
